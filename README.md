Concept project informed by my clinical experience and designed as a personal initiative to explore patient-centred mobile tools
# Empower: Symptom Management Companion for Breast Cancer Patients

👩🏽‍⚕️ Created by: Folasade Akinyemi  
🎯 Role: Product Manager & Clinical UX Lead  
🗓️ Timeline: July 2025 (Passion Project)



## 🌸 Overview

Empower is a concept-stage mobile app I designed to support women navigating breast cancer treatment. Drawing from my years as an Advanced Clinical Practitioner in Breast, I wanted to create a simple, dignified way for patients to track symptoms, flag concerns early, and feel more in control of their care between appointments.

This is my love letter to the patients I’ve served, and a UX-first response to a real clinical gap.



## 🤒 The Problem

Symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, or nausea often go underreported because:
 * Patients don’t know what’s “normal”
 * Women (which makes up most of this patient group) are termed hysterical and have their concerns dismissed.
 * It’s hard to track over time or remember later
 * They’re unsure when to speak up

There’s room for a lightweight, warm, and clinically informed tool that supports without overwhelming.



## 📱 Solution Highlights (MVP)

- **Daily Symptom Check-ins** using emoji sliders + notes
  
- **Smart Flag System** based on UKONS toxicity guidelines
  
- **Energy & Mood Trends** to help patients spot patterns
  
- **Downloadable Summary** for sharing with care teams
  
- **Self-Care Library** based on clusters (e.g. fatigue + anxiety)


## 🌱 Future Features (Stretch Goals)
- AI-driven symptom pattern detection
- Integration with Apple Health/Fitbit for sleep/activity overlay
- Chat-based “symptom coach” (not diagnostic, just supportive)


## 🎨 UX Principles
1. Support, not surveillance  
2. Clarity over complexity  
3. Dignity in design

I built low-fidelity wireframes in Figma and mapped journeys with mock personas based on real patient profiles.


## 💼 My Role

This was a personal initiative, designed to sharpen my product thinking while staying close to the human experience. I defined the concept, wrote user flows, developed risk logic, and drafted a lightweight product roadmap.



## 🛠 Tools & Process
- **Figma** for wireframes and user flows
  
- **Miro** for journey mapping
  
- **Notion & Docs** for documentation and roadmap
  
- **Python (light)** to explore toxicity scoring logic



## 💬 Reflections

This project reminded me that powerful products don't have to be complex, they just need to make people feel heard, seen, and safe. It also helped me grow as a PM who never forgets the person behind the persona.



## ✨ Let’s Connect

If you’re working on digital tools for oncology, women’s health, or patient empowerment, I’d love to hear what you’re building. This space matters and isn't talked about enough.
